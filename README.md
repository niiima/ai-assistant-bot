# Telegram Bot with Voice-to-Speech feature and System Prompt

This Telegram Bot is powered by Node.js and uses the Telegram Bot API to communicate with users. Its main feature is the integration with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine that allows users to ask questions and receive answers in a natural way. Additionally, the bot supports voice-to-speech feature to help users who prefer audio input/output. The bot also uses the setSystemPrompt command to create a system prompt to direct AI to what user needs more efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running npm install in the terminal.
3. Rename .env.example file to .env and add your Telegram bot token and FFMPEG and Whisper API credentials.
4. Start the bot by running npm start in the terminal.

## Voice-to-Speech feature

This Telegram Bot also supports voice-to-speech feature to help users who prefer audio input/output. The bot uses FFMPEG to convert the voice message sent by the user to a format suitable for processing by the NLP engine. After the NLP engine processes the message, the bot uses whisper API to create an audio response and sends it back to the user.

## System Prompt

The bot also uses the setSystemPrompt command to create a system prompt to direct AI to what user needs more efficiently. This prompt helps the NLP engine to better understand what the user wants, resulting in a more accurate response.
